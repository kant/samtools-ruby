samtools-ruby

Introduction
Binder of samtools for ruby, on the top of FFI. 

This project was born from the need to add support of BAM files to 
the gee_fu genome browser (http://github.com/danmaclean/gee_fu). 

Installation
At the moment, the only way to "install" the module is to copy the content 
of the lib folder on any lib folder you have. You must also copy your libbam.a (linux)
or libbam.dll (windows) from samtools. If you have a Mac, add the following variable
to the makefile of samtools

DYFLAGS 	= -dynamiclib -lz

and the following target:
dylib: libbam.dylib
libbam.dylib:$(LOBJS)
		$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(DYFLAGS) -o libbam.dylib $(LOBJS)

Then, run 

make dylib

Finally, you copy the .dylib file to your lib folder. 

Usage
The easiest way to see in "action" samtools-ruby to call
rake test. 


Dependencies:
